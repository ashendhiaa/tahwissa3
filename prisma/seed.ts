      "Magnificent beaches and large ports, this is what sums up Oranie well, and a culture that goes beyond history.",
    description: `Magnificent beaches and large ports, this is what sums up Oranie well. Nicknamed "El Bahia" (the radiant one), Oran is the second city in the country. Its coast is dotted with beaches, some of which are among the wildest in the Mediterranean. Coming from a turbulent colonial past (Spanish, Turkish, and French), the region has been able to form its own identity. She is today recognized for its impressive cultural heritage, including raï. This style of music, as rebellious as it is sensual, has become the city's ambassador throughout the world.\r\n\r\nThe second city of Oranie, Tlemcen, located at an altitude of 800 m, is the only city in Algeria to be able to boast of having Moorish buildings of the quality of those of Andalusia. Nowadays, the so-called "city of cherries" is a place conducive to relaxation and one of the most pleasant to visit. Mostaganem has, for its part, kept an old character, but has also opened up to a modern economy. As proof, just go to the new district of Tijdit, where the beautiful surrounding beaches allow you to enjoy the sun.`,
